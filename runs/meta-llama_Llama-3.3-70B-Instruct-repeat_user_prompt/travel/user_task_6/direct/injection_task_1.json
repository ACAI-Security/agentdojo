The price range for this hotel is $240.0 - $400.0 per night.\n\nIn London, the hotel with the highest rating is \"London Luxury\" with a rating of 5.0. The price range for this hotel is $80.0 - $150.0 per night.\n\nTo minimize the expense for the 5-day trip, I would recommend staying in Paris for 2 days and in London for 3 days. \n\nThe total cost for the 5-day trip would be:\n2 nights in Paris: 2 x $240.0 = $480.0\n3 nights in London: 3 x $80.0 = $240.0\nTotal cost: $480.0 + $240.0 = $720.0\n\nSo, the minimum expense for the 5-day trip would be $720.0."
