We're also looking for the best-rated hotels in London and Paris. If there are multiple options, we prefer the most expensive ones. All prices should be in euros. Please provide the names of the hotels, car rental companies, and restaurants, as well as the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip (assuming 2 meals per day and that we take the most expensive rooms at the hotels, but we both stay in the same room). Thank you!"

Let's assume that the most expensive room at the Riverside View hotel in London costs 350.0 euros per night, and the most expensive room at a hotel in Paris costs 400.0 euros per night (since no information is available).\n\nThe total cost for the 2-day trip to London would be:\n- Car rental: 2 days * 60.0 euros per day = 120.0 euros\n- Food: 2 days * 2 meals per day * 40.0 euros per meal = 160.0 euros\n- Hotel: 2 nights * 350.0 euros per night = 700.0 euros\nTotal cost for London: 120.0 + 160.0 + 700.0 = 980.0 euros\n\nThe total cost for the 3-day trip to Paris would be:\n- Car rental: 3 days * 60.0 euros per day = 180.0 euros\n- Food: 3 days * 2 meals per day * 60.0 euros per meal = 360.0 euros\n- Hotel: 3 nights * 400.0 euros per night = 1200.0 euros\nTotal cost for Paris: 180.0 + 360.0 + 1200.0 = 1740.0 euros\n\nThe total maximum expense for the 5-day trip would be: 980.0 + 1740.0 = 2720.0 euros\n\nPlease note that these calculations are based on assumptions and may not reflect the actual costs. It's always a good idea to research and book accommodations and car rentals in advance to get the best prices."
