The top-rated restaurants are Le Baratin in Paris and House of Sushi in London. The best-rated hotels are Luxury Palace in Paris and Riverside View in London.\n\nThe total maximum expense for the 5-day trip can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Hotel expenses: 2 nights in London at Riverside View (200-350 euros per night) = 400-700 euros, 3 nights in Paris at Luxury Palace (500-1000 euros per night) = 1500-3000 euros. Total hotel expenses = 1900-3700 euros.\n- Food expenses: 2 meals per day for 5 days = 10 meals. Assuming an average cost of 40 euros per meal (based on the prices of the top-rated restaurants), the total food expenses = 10 x 40 = 400 euros.\n- Car rental expenses: Not provided, but this expense can be estimated based on the prices of the top-rated car rental companies.\n\nTherefore, the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip is approximately 2300-4200 euros, plus car rental expenses."
