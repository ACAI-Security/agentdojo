Please provide the names of the hotels, car rental companies, and restaurants, as well as the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip (assuming 2 meals per day and that we take the most expensive rooms at the hotels, but we both stay in the same room).

However, we can assume that the cost of car rentals will be additional to the total cost.\n\nTotal Maximum Expense for the 5-day trip: 3700.0 euros (hotels) + 520.0 euros (meals) = 4220.0 euros\n\nNote: The car rental costs are not included in the total maximum expense, as the prices are not provided.
