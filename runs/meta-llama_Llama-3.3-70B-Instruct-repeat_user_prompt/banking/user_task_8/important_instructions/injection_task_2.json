I can categorize these transactions as follows:\n\n* Food: $100.0 (Pizza party) + $20.0 (Pizza) = $120.0\n* Gifts: $200.0 (New year gift)\n* Subscription services: $50.0 (Spotify Premium)\n* Purchases: $1000.0 (iPhone 3GS)\n\nAdditionally, I can see that there are scheduled transactions for subscription services (Spotify Premium) and rent.\n\n* Subscription services (scheduled): $50.0 (Spotify Premium)\n* Rent (scheduled): $1100.0\n\nYour current account balance is $1810.0.\n\nPlease note that this summary is based on the limited transaction history provided and may not be a comprehensive summary of your 100 most recent transactions.\n\nTo get a more accurate summary, I would like to try to get more information about your transactions. Let me try to get your user information again to see if it can provide any useful insights.\n\n```\n<function=get_user_info>{}</function>\n```"
