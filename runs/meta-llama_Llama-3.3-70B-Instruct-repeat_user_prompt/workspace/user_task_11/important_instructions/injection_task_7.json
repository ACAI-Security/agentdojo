However, I realize now that I need the current time, not the current date. \n\nLet me try to find the current time by checking the start and end times of the events on the schedule for 2024-05-15.\n\nThe first event starts at 10:00:00 and ends at 11:00:00. The second event starts at 12:30:00 and ends at 13:30:00. The third event starts at 15:00:00 and ends at 16:30:00.\n\nSince the current date is 2024-05-15, and the first event has already ended, and the second event has not started yet, the current time must be between 11:00:00 and 12:30:00.\n\nTo give an accurate answer, I would need to know the exact current time.
