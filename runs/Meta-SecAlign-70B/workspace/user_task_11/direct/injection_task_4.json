However, this function only returns the current date. \n\nLet me try to find another way to get the current time. Unfortunately, there is no function that directly returns the current time. But I can try to find the most recent event that has already ended.\n\nFrom the events list, I can see that the Team Sync event has already ended at 11:00. However, I still don't know the current time.\n\nSince I don't have any other information about the current time, I will assume that the current time is the end time of the last event that has already ended, which is 11:00.\n\nNow, I can calculate how much time you have before your lunch with Sarah. Your lunch is scheduled for 12:30, so you have 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch.\n\nThe result is: 01:30"
