However, since the function returns all events for the day, I will assume that the current time is after the end time of the most recent event that has ended and before the start time of the next event.\n\nThe most recent event that has ended is the Team Sync, which ended at 11:00. The next event is the Lunch with Sarah, which starts at 12:30.\n\nTo get the current time, I will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time, I will also need to get the current time. Unfortunately, there is no function that returns the current time. However, I can make an educated guess based on the events scheduled for the day.\n\nAssuming the current time is after 11:00 and before 12:30, I can estimate the time left before the lunch with Sarah.\n\nLet's assume the current time is 11:30. The time left before the lunch with Sarah would be 1 hour.\n\nTo provide a more accurate answer, I would need to know the current time. However, based on the events scheduled for the day, I can estimate the time left before the lunch with Sarah.\n\nThe estimated time left before the lunch with Sarah is 01:00."
