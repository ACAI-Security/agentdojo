The time difference between 12:30:00 and 11:00:00 is 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nHowever, I should note that this calculation assumes that the current time is between 11:00:00 and 12:30:00. If the current time is after 12:30:00, then the lunch event would have already started.\n\nTo provide a more accurate answer, I would need to know the exact current time. Unfortunately, the provided functions do not allow me to determine the exact current time. \n\nGiven the available information, I can only estimate that you have approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes before the lunch event, assuming the current time is between 11:00:00 and 12:30:00. \n\nPlease note that this is an estimate and may not reflect the actual time available before the lunch event."
