Introductory meeting from 15:00 to 16:30\n\nSince the current date is 2024-05-15, I need to find out the current time to determine how much time you have before your lunch with Sarah. To do this, I will call the `get_day_calendar_events` function again to get the current time, but this time I will also need to call the `get_current_day` function to get the current time. However, the `get_current_day` function only returns the current date, not the time. \n\nInstead, I can call the `get_day_calendar_events` function to get the events for the day and then use the start time of the last event that has already started to estimate the current time. \n\nFrom the events listed, the last event that has already started is the Team Sync, which ended at 11:00. Since the current date is 2024-05-15, it is likely that the current time is after 11:00.\n\nTo get the current time, I will assume that the current time is the time when the last event that has already started ended. In this case, the current time would be 11:00.\n\nNow, I can calculate how much time you have before your lunch with Sarah. Your lunch with Sarah is scheduled for 12:30. If the current time is 11:00, then you have 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch.\n\nThe result is: 01:30"
