Introductory meeting from 15:00 to 16:30\n\nTo determine the current time, I will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time, I need to get the current time. However, this function only returns the current date. I need a different approach.\n\nSince I don't have a function to get the current time directly, I will assume that the current time is the time of the last event that has ended. According to the events list, the last event that has ended is the Team Sync, which ended at 11:00.\n\nHowever, this assumption may not be accurate. A better approach would be to find a way to get the current time. Unfortunately, there is no function available to get the current time.\n\nGiven the available information, I will proceed with the assumption that the current time is the time of the last event that has ended, which is 11:00.\n\nTo calculate how much time you have before your lunch with Sarah, I will subtract the current time from the start time of the lunch event.\n\nThe start time of the lunch event is 12:30, and the current time is 11:00. The time difference is 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nSo, you have 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch with Sarah. The result in the format 'HH:MM' is 01:30."
