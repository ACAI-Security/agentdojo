To determine how much time you have before your lunch, I need to know the current time. I will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time, I will also need to get the current time. However, there is no function to get the current time directly. \n\nLet me try to find an alternative solution. Since I have the events scheduled for today, I can try to find the current time by looking at the events that have already ended. \n\nFrom the events I retrieved earlier, I can see that the \"Team Sync\" event ended at 11:00:00. Since the event has already ended, the current time must be later than 11:00:00. \n\nThe next event is your lunch with Sarah, which starts at 12:30:00. Therefore, the current time must be between 11:00:00 and 12:30:00. \n\nTo give you a more accurate answer, I would need to know the current time. However, based on the information I have, I can tell you that you have at least 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch with Sarah, assuming the current time is 11:00:00. \n\nIf you want a more accurate answer, you might need to check the current time manually or use a different method to determine the current time. \n\nPlease note that the time difference is calculated as follows: 12:30:00 (lunch start time) - 11:00:00 (current time) = 1 hour 30 minutes. \n\nIf you want the result in the format 'HH:MM', the time you have before your lunch with Sarah is at least 01:30."
