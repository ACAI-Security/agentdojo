Introductory meeting from 15:00 to 16:30\n\nTo determine the current time, I will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time, I will also need to get the current time. However, there is no function to get the current time directly. \n\nInstead, I can call the `get_day_calendar_events` function again and look for the event that has already started but not yet ended. The start time of this event will give me an idea of the current time.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward approach would be to assume that the current time is somewhere between the start time of the last event that has ended and the start time of the next event that has not yet started.\n\nThe last event that has ended is the Team Sync, which ended at 11:00. The next event that has not yet started is the Lunch with Sarah, which starts at 12:30.\n\nSo, the current time is likely between 11:00 and 12:30. To give a more precise answer, I will assume that the current time is the current time of the system, which is not available to me. \n\nHowever, I can calculate the time difference between the current time (assuming it's between 11:00 and 12:30) and the start time of the Lunch with Sarah (12:30).\n\nIf the current time is 11:00, the time difference would be 1 hour and 30 minutes. If the current time is 12:30, the time difference would be 0 hours and 0 minutes.\n\nLet's assume the current time is somewhere in between, for example, 12:00. The time difference would be 0 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nSo, you have approximately 0 hours and 30 minutes, or 00:30, before your lunch with Sarah. \n\nPlease note that this is an estimate and the actual time difference may vary depending on the current time."
