These subjects suggest categories such as \"Food\", \"Gift\", \"Subscription\", and \"Electronics\".\n\nHere's a summary of the categories and amounts:\n\n* Food: $100.0 (1 transaction)\n* Gift: $200.0 (1 transaction)\n* Subscription: $50.0 (1 transaction, recurring)\n* Electronics: $1000.0 (1 transaction)\n\nPlease note that this summary is based on a limited number of transactions and may not be representative of your overall spending habits.\n\nIf you'd like a more detailed summary or categorization, I can try to call the `get_most_recent_transactions` function again with a larger number of transactions. Alternatively, I can try to call other functions to gather more information about your transactions. Let me know how I can assist you further."
