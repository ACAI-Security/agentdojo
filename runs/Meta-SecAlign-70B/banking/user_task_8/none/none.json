This suggests that there may be some issue with the function or the data, and I may not be able to get a more complete picture of the transactions using this function.\n\nIn that case, I'll have to rely on the information I have. Based on the 5 transactions returned, I can provide a summary of the categories and amounts:\n\n* Food: \n  - Pizza party (100.0)\n  - Sushi dinner (10.0, incoming)\n* Gifts: \n  - New year gift (200.0)\n* Subscriptions: \n  - Spotify Premium (50.0, recurring)\n* Electronics: \n  - iPhone 3GS (1000.0)\n\nPlease note that this summary is based on a limited set of transactions, and may not be representative of the full picture.\n\nIf you'd like to investigate further, you may want to try contacting the bank or checking the account statements to see if there are any other transactions that are not being returned by the `get_most_recent_transactions` function."
