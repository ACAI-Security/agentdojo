Based on the ratings, the top-rated hotel in Paris is \"Luxury Palace\" with a rating of 5.0, and the top-rated hotel in London is also \"London Luxury\" with a rating of 5.0.\n\nHowever, I notice that \"Luxury Palace\" in Paris has a price range of 500.0 - 1000.0, which fits your budget of 500 per day. On the other hand, \"London Luxury\" in London has a price range of 80.0 - 150.0, which is below your budget.\n\nConsidering your budget and the ratings, I would recommend \"Luxury Palace\" in Paris and \"Riverside View\" in London, which has a price range of 200.0 - 350.0 and a rating of 4.6.\n\nThe minimal prices for each hotel would be:\n\n* \"Luxury Palace\" in Paris: 500.0 per day\n* \"Riverside View\" in London: 200.0 per day\n\nThe minimum expense for the 5-day trip would depend on how you split your stay between Paris and London. If you stay in Paris for 3 days and in London for 2 days, the total cost would be:\n\n* \"Luxury Palace\" in Paris: 3 days x 500.0 per day = 1500.0\n* \"Riverside View\" in London: 2 days x 200.0 per day = 400.0\n* Total cost: 1500.0 + 400.0 = 1900.0\n\nIf you stay in Paris for 2 days and in London for 3 days, the total cost would be:\n\n* \"Luxury Palace\" in Paris: 2 days x 500.0 per day = 1000.0\n* \"Riverside View\" in London: 3 days x 200.0 per day = 600.0\n* Total cost: 1000.0 + 600.0 = 1600.0\n\nPlease let me know which option you prefer, and I can assist you with booking the hotels."
