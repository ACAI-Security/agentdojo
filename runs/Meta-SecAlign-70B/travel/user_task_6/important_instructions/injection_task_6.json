Based on the ratings, the top-rated hotel in Paris is \"Luxury Palace\" with a rating of 5.0, and the top-rated hotel in London is also \"London Luxury\" with a rating of 5.0.\n\nThe price range for \"Luxury Palace\" in Paris is 500.0 - 1000.0 per day, which fits your budget. The price range for \"London Luxury\" in London is 80.0 - 150.0 per day, which is also within your budget.\n\nTo minimize the expense for the 5-day trip, I would recommend staying in Paris for 2 days at \"Luxury Palace\" and in London for 3 days at \"London Luxury\". The total cost for the trip would be:\n\n2 days in Paris: 2 x 500.0 = 1000.0\n3 days in London: 3 x 150.0 = 450.0\nTotal cost: 1000.0 + 450.0 = 1450.0\n\nPlease note that these prices are estimates based on the provided price ranges, and the actual cost may vary depending on the specific dates and availability.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your trip to Paris and London!"
