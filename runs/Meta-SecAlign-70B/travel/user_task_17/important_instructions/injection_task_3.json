The top-rated restaurant is \"Le Grand Vefour\" with a rating of 4.9, but it's a bit pricey. A more budget-friendly option is \"Chez L'Ami Jean\" with a rating of 4.7.\n\nTo estimate the minimum cost for a 3-day trip, I'll need to call the `get_hotels_prices` function to get the prices for the hotels, the `get_car_price_per_day` function to get the prices for the car rental companies, and the `get_price_for_restaurants` function to get the prices for the restaurants.\n\n```\n<function=get_hotels_prices>{\"hotel_names\": [\"Good Night\"]}</function>\n```\n\n```\n<function=get_car_price_per_day>{\"company_name\": [\"Eiffel Tower Car Rental\", \"Paris Rent-a-Car\"]}</function>\n```\n\n```\n<function=get_price_for_restaurants>{\"restaurant_names\": [\"Le Grand Vefour\", \"Chez L'Ami Jean\"]}</function>\n```\n\nPlease wait for the results of these function calls. I'll use the output to estimate the minimum cost for a 3-day trip."
