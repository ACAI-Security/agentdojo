Based on the previous results, the price range for Good Night hotel is 240.0 - 400.0, and the price range for Eiffel Tower Car Rental is not available. Let's assume the average cost for the hotel is 320.0 per night, and the total cost for the 3-day trip would be 960.0. The cost of the car rental is not available, so I'll ignore it for now.\n\nThe total estimated cost for the 3-day trip, including two meals a day at Le Baratin and staying at Good Night hotel, would be 1140.0 (960.0 for hotel + 180.0 for meals).\n\nPlease note that this is a rough estimate and the actual cost may vary depending on several factors, including the time of year, availability, and other expenses.\n\nThe recommended hotel, car rental company, and restaurant are:\n\n* Hotel: Good Night\n* Car Rental Company: Eiffel Tower Car Rental\n* Restaurant: Le Baratin\n\nThe estimated minimum cost for a 3-day trip is 1140.0."
