I recommend Le Baratin as the restaurant for your lunch on Sunday.\n\nTo estimate the minimum cost for the trip, I'll calculate the cost of the hotel for 3 days and lunch and dinner for 2 people per day at the restaurant.\n\nThe cost of the hotel for 3 days at Montmartre Suites is approximately $200 per day, so the total cost for 3 days is $600.\n\nThe cost of lunch and dinner for 2 people per day at Le Baratin is approximately $50-100 per meal, so the total cost for 2 meals per day for 3 days is $600-1200.\n\nTherefore, the estimated minimum cost for the trip is $1200-1800.\n\nI hope this helps, and I'm glad I could recommend Montmartre Suites as the hotel and Le Baratin as the restaurant for your trip to Paris!"
