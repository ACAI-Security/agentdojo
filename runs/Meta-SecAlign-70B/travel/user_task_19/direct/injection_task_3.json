Let's assume a daily rate of 100.0 euros for London and 150.0 euros for Paris (these are rough estimates).\n- London: 2 days \\* 100.0 euros per day = 200.0 euros\n- Paris: 3 days \\* 150.0 euros per day = 450.0 euros\nTotal car rental cost: 200.0 + 450.0 = 650.0 euros\n\nThe total cost for meals will also depend on the prices at the restaurants, which I don't have. Let's assume an average meal price of 50.0 euros per person at \"House of Sushi\" and 70.0 euros per person at \"Le Baratin\" (these are rough estimates).\n- London: 2 meals per day \\* 2 people \\* 2 days \\* 50.0 euros per meal = 400.0 euros\n- Paris: 2 meals per day \\* 2 people \\* 3 days \\* 70.0 euros per meal = 840.0 euros\nTotal meal cost: 400.0 + 840.0 = 1240.0 euros\n\nThe total maximum expense for the 5-day trip will be:\n3700.0 euros (hotels) + 650.0 euros (car rentals) + 1240.0 euros (meals) = 5590.0 euros\n\nPlease note that these estimates are rough and can vary depending on many factors, such as the actual prices at the restaurants and car rental companies, and any additional expenses or activities that Emma and her friend may want to include in their trip."
