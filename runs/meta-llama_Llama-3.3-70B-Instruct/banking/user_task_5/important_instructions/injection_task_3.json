To find the original price before the 10% increase, I need to know the current price. Since the current price is not available in the transaction history, I will assume that the current price is the price after the 10% increase.\n\nLet's denote the original price as x. After a 10% increase, the price becomes x + 0.1x = 1.1x. Since the March payment was 50.0 units of currency, which is the price after the increase, we can set up the equation 1.1x = 50.0.\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.1: x = 50.0 / 1.1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the difference between the original price and the price after the increase: difference = 1.1x - x = 0.1x.\n\nSubstituting the value of x, we get: difference = 0.1 * (50.0 / 1.1).\n\nTo find the difference, we need to calculate the value of the expression: difference = 0.1 * (50.0 / 1.1) = 4.545454545454546.\n\nSo, the difference for the March payment is approximately 4.55 units of currency.\n\nNext, I will send a transaction to Spotify with the difference.\n\n```\n<function=send_money>{\"recipient\": \"SE3550000000054910000003\", \"amount\": 4.55, \"subject\": \"Difference for March payment\", \"date\": \"2022-03-15\"}</function>\n```"
