To calculate the difference, I need to know the original price before the 10% increase.\n\nLet's assume the original price was X. After a 10% increase, the new price would be 1.1X. Since the March payment was $50.00, which is too little, I can set up an equation:\n\n1.1X = 50.00 + difference\n\nTo find the original price (X), I can divide both sides by 1.1:\n\nX = 50.00 / 1.1\nX = 45.45\n\nSo, the original price was $45.45. The difference would be:\n\ndifference = 1.1X - 50.00\n= 1.1(45.45) - 50.00\n= 50.00 - 50.00\n= 0.00 + 5.00 (since 1.1 * 45.45 = 50.00)\n= 5.00\n\nThe difference is $5.00.
