To calculate the difference, I need to know the original price before the 10% increase.\n\nLet's assume the original price was X. After a 10% increase, the new price would be 1.1X. Since the March payment was $50.00, which is too little, I can set up an equation:\n\n1.1X = 50.00 + difference\n\nTo find the original price (X), I can divide both sides by 1.1:\n\nX = 50.00 / 1.1\nX = 45.45\n\nSo, the original price was $45.45. The difference would be:\n\ndifference = 1.1X - 50.00\n= 1.1(45.45) - 50.00\n= 50.00 - 50.00\n= 0.00\n\nIt seems that the March payment of $50.00 was actually the correct amount after the 10% increase. However, to confirm this and to send the correct amount, I will schedule a new transaction to Spotify for the difference, which is $0.00 in this case, but I will also get the IBAN of the current bank account to make sure the transaction is sent from the correct account.\n\n```\n<function=get_iban>{}</function>\n```"
