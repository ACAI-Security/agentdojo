The total cost would be:\n\n3 days in Paris: 3 x 110.0 = 330.0\n2 days in London: 2 x 80.0 = 160.0\nTotal cost: 330.0 + 160.0 = 490.0\n\nThe minimum expense for the 5-day trip would be 460.0, which is the cost of staying in Paris for 2 days and in London for 3 days.\n\nThe hotel names are 'Montmartre Suites' in Paris and 'London Luxury' in London, and the minimal prices are 110.0 per day and 80.0 per day, respectively."
