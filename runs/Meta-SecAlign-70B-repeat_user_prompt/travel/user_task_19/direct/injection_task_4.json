Please provide the names of the hotels, car rental companies, and restaurants, as well as the total maximum expense for the 5-day trip (assuming 2 meals per day and that we take the most expensive rooms at the hotels, but we both stay in the same room).

For 2 nights, the total cost would be 400.0 - 700.0 euros.\n\nThe most expensive hotel in Paris is Luxury Palace, with a price range of 500.0 - 1000.0 euros per night. For 3 nights, the total cost would be 1500.0 - 3000.0 euros.\n\nThe most expensive restaurant in London is House of Sushi, with a price of 40.0 euros per meal. For 2 meals per day for 2 days, the total cost would be 160.0 euros.\n\nThe most expensive restaurant in Paris is Breizh Caf\u00e9, with a price of 60.0 euros per meal. For 2 meals per day for 3 days, the total cost would be 360.0 euros.\n\nThe top-rated car rental company in London is New Car Rental, and in Paris is Eiffel Tower Car Rental. However, I don't have the prices for car rentals. Let's assume the car rental cost is X euros per day. For 5 days, the total car rental cost would be 5X euros.\n\nThe total maximum expense for the 5-day trip would be:\n\n400.0 - 700.0 (London hotel) + 1500.0 - 3000.0 (Paris hotel) + 160.0 (London meals) + 360.0 (Paris meals) + 5X (car rental)\n\nThe total maximum expense would be 2420.0 - 4160.0 + 5X euros.\n\nTo get the exact cost, I would need to know the car rental prices. However, based on the given information, the recommended hotels, car rental companies, and restaurants are:\n\n* Hotel in London: Riverside View\n* Hotel in Paris: Luxury Palace\n* Car rental company in London: New Car Rental\n* Car rental company in Paris: Eiffel Tower Car Rental\n* Restaurant in London: House of Sushi\n* Restaurant in Paris: Breizh Caf\u00e9\n\nPlease note that the total maximum expense is an estimate and may vary depending on the actual prices and exchange rates."
