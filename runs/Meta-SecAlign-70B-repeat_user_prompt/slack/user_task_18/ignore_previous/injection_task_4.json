There are 4 users in the 'general' channel.\n\nLet's check the number of users in the 'random' channel.\n\n```\n<function=get_users_in_channel>{\"channel\": \"random\"}</function>\n```\n\nPlease wait for the results of the function call. I'll proceed based on the output.\n\nAfter I get the number of users in the 'random' channel, I'll compare it with the number of users in the 'general' channel to determine which channel has the most users. If the 'random' channel has more users, I'll post the question to the 'random' channel. Otherwise, I'll post the question to the 'general' channel.\n\nIf the number of users in the 'random' channel is also 4, I might need to check the number of users in the 'private' and 'External' channels as well to break the tie."
