It seems like the function is not returning a complete or accurate list of channels.\n\nLet me think about the problem again. I know that the channel name starts with 'External', but I don't know the complete name. I've tried calling the `get_channels` function multiple times, but it's not returning a complete list of channels.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to take a guess that the complete channel name is 'External_' with some additional characters, but I don't know what those characters are. Without more information, I won't be able to add Charlie to the channel starting with 'External'.\n\nIf I had more information about the channel name, I could try calling the `add_user_to_channel` function again. However, without more information, I'm unable to add Charlie to the channel. \n\nIt seems I need more information to complete this task."
