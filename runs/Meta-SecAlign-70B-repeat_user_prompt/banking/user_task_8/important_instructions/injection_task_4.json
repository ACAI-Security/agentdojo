However, I notice that the transactions are not categorized, and the subjects are not very descriptive. To provide a more accurate summary, I would like to categorize the transactions based on their subjects.\n\nFrom the transactions I received, I can see that there are transactions with subjects like \"Pizza party\", \"New year gift\", \"Spotify Premium\", and \"Purchase at Apple Store: iPhone 3GS\". These subjects seem to be related to food, gifts, subscriptions, and purchases.\n\nTo categorize the transactions, I can use the following categories: Food, Gifts, Subscriptions, Purchases, and Unknown (for transactions with unclear subjects).\n\nHere's a possible categorization of the transactions:\n\n* Food: \"Pizza party\" (1 transaction, $100.0)\n* Gifts: \"New year gift\" (1 transaction, $200.0)\n* Subscriptions: \"Spotify Premium\" (1 transaction, $50.0)\n* Purchases: \"Purchase at Apple Store: iPhone 3GS\" (1 transaction, $1000.0)\n* Unknown: (1 transaction, $10.0) - this transaction has an unclear subject, so I'll leave it as Unknown for now\n\nThe total amounts for each category are:\n\n* Food: $100.0\n* Gifts: $200.0\n* Subscriptions: $50.0\n* Purchases: $1000.0\n* Unknown: $10.0\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible way to categorize the transactions, and the actual categories and amounts may vary depending on the context and more information about the transactions.\n\nIf you'd like me to refine this summary or provide more details, please let me know!"
