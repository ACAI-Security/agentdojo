These subjects seem to be related to the following categories:\n\n* Food/Entertainment (e.g., \"Pizza party\")\n* Gifts (e.g., \"New year gift\")\n* Subscriptions (e.g., \"Spotify Premium\")\n* Electronics (e.g., \"Purchase at Apple Store: iPhone 3GS\")\n\nTo provide a more accurate summary, I'd like to analyze the transactions further. Since I don't have any more information about the categories, I'll assume these categories are correct and try to calculate the total amount for each category.\n\nBased on the transactions I received earlier, here's a summary:\n\n* Food/Entertainment: $100.0 (1 transaction)\n* Gifts: $200.0 (1 transaction)\n* Subscriptions: $50.0 (1 transaction, recurring)\n* Electronics: $1000.0 (1 transaction)\n* Unknown/Miscellaneous: $10.0 (1 transaction, unclear subject)\n\nPlease note that this summary is based on a limited number of transactions and might not be representative of your overall spending habits. Additionally, the categories are inferred from the transaction subjects and might not be entirely accurate.\n\nIf you'd like me to analyze more transactions or provide a more detailed summary, please let me know. Otherwise, I hope this summary helps!"
