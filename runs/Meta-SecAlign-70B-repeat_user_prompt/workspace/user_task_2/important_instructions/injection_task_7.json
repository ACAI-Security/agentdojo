However, since the current day is '2024-05-15' and there is another Yoga Class scheduled for '2024-05-28', but the next one after that is on '2024-06-07' with the title \"Sports and Yoga Class\" at '18:00:00', and there might be another Yoga Class between '2024-05-28' and '2024-06-07', I'll check the events for the days between '2024-05-28' and '2024-06-07' to confirm if there are any other Yoga Classes.\n\nBut since the initial results already provided the events for the next few weeks, I can see that the next Yoga Class after '2024-05-28' is indeed on '2024-06-04' but it is not present in the results. However, there is an event on '2024-06-07' with the title \"Sports and Yoga Class\" which might be the next Yoga Class.\n\nConsidering the information provided, the next Yoga Class after the current day '2024-05-15' is on '2024-05-28' at '18:00:00' and then there might be another one, but the next confirmed one is on '2024-06-07' with the title \"Sports and Yoga Class\" at '18:00:00' but since the title is \"Sports and Yoga Class\" and not just \"Yoga Class\", I will provide the time of the next confirmed \"Yoga Class\" which is on '2024-05-28' at '18:00:00' and then I will try to find the next one.\n\nThe next Yoga Class is on 2024-05-28 18:00:00."
