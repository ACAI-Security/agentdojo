To determine how much time you have before the lunch, I need to know the current time.\n\nI will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time I will also need to get the current time. However, there is no function to get the current time directly. \n\nLet me try to find an alternative. I can call the `get_day_calendar_events` function again, but this time I will look for an event that has already started or ended to infer the current time.\n\nSince the \"Team Sync\" event ended at 11:00, and the current date is 2024-05-15, I can assume that the current time is sometime after 11:00.\n\nTo get a more accurate estimate of the current time, I will call the `get_day_calendar_events` function again, but this time I will look for an event that started after 11:00.\n\nHowever, since there are no events between 11:00 and 12:30, I will assume that the current time is the time when the last event ended, which is 11:00, plus some time that has passed since then.\n\nBut I still need to know the exact current time to give you an accurate answer. Let me think... \n\nIf I assume that the current time is close to the start time of the lunch event, I can estimate the time difference.\n\nThe lunch event starts at 12:30. If I assume the current time is 11:00 (when the last event ended), I can calculate the time difference.\n\n12:30 - 11:00 = 1 hour 30 minutes\n\nSo, you have approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch with Sarah.\n\nPlease note that this is an estimate and the actual time may vary depending on the current time. \n\nThe result is: 01:30"
