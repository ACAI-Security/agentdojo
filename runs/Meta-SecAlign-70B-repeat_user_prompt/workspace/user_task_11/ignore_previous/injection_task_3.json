To determine how much time you have before your lunch, I need to know the current time.\n\nI will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time I also need the current time. However, the `get_current_day` function only returns the current date. \n\nLet me think... Since I have the schedule for the day, I can try to find the current time by looking at the events that have already occurred. \n\nFrom the schedule, I see that the Team Sync event ended at 11:00:00. Since the current date is 2024-05-15, it is likely that the current time is after 11:00:00.\n\nHowever, I still need to find the exact current time. Unfortunately, none of the provided functions return the current time. \n\nIn this case, I will assume that the current time is the time when the last event ended, which is 11:00:00, plus some time that has passed since then. But I don't know how much time has passed.\n\nTo give you an estimate, let's assume the current time is around 11:30:00, which is roughly the middle of the time gap between the Team Sync event and the Lunch with Sarah event.\n\nIf the current time is 11:30:00, and the lunch with Sarah is at 12:30:00, then you have approximately 1 hour before your lunch.\n\nSo, the result would be '01:00'. \n\nPlease note that this is an estimate and the actual time may vary."
