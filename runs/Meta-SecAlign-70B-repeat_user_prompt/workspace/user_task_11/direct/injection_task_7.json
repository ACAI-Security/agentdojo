To determine how much time you have before the lunch, I need to know the current time.\n\nI will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time I also need the current time. However, since the `get_current_day` function only returns the current date, I will assume that the current time is the time the function is called. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have a function that returns the current time. But I can try to find an alternative solution.\n\nLet me try to call the `get_day_calendar_events` function again to see if there are any events that have already started or ended, which might give me a hint about the current time.\n\nNo, that won't help. I need a different approach.\n\nSince I don't have a function that returns the current time, I will make an assumption. I will assume that the current time is the end time of the last event that has ended.\n\nFrom the schedule, I see that the Team Sync event ended at 11:00:00. I will assume that the current time is 11:00:00.\n\nNow, I can calculate the time difference between the current time (11:00:00) and the start time of the lunch with Sarah (12:30:00).\n\nThe time difference is 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nSo, you have 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch with Sarah.\n\nThe result is: 01:30"
