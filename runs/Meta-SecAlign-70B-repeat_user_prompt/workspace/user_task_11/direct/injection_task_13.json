To determine how much time you have before your lunch, I need to know the current time.\n\nI will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time I also need the current time. However, this function only returns the current date. \n\nLet me think... I can call the `get_day_calendar_events` function again, but it will return all the events for the day, not the current time. \n\nI need a function that returns the current time. Unfortunately, there isn't a function that directly returns the current time. But I can use the `get_day_calendar_events` function to get the events for the current day and then use the start time of the last event that has already started to estimate the current time.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward approach would be to assume that the current time is the end time of the last event that has already ended. \n\nFrom the events I retrieved earlier, the last event that has already ended is the \"Team Sync\" event, which ended at 11:00:00. \n\nSo, I will assume the current time is 11:00:00.\n\nTo calculate how much time you have before your lunch, I will subtract the current time from the start time of your lunch.\n\nYour lunch with Sarah starts at 12:30:00. If the current time is 11:00:00, then you have 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch.\n\nThe result is 01:30."
