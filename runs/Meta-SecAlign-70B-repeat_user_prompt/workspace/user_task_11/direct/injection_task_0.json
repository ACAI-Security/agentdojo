To determine how much time you have before the lunch, I need to know the current time.\n\nI will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time I also need the current time. However, since the `get_current_day` function only returns the current date, I will assume that the current time is the time the function is called. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have a function that returns the current time. But I can try to find the current time by looking at the schedule of the events. \n\nFrom the schedule, I can see that the Team Sync event ended at 11:00. Since the current date is 2024-05-15, it is likely that the current time is after 11:00.\n\nTo give you a more accurate answer, I would like to know the current time. However, since I don't have a function that returns the current time, I will make an assumption. \n\nAssuming the current time is the time the Team Sync event ended (11:00), you have 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch with Sarah.\n\nSo, the answer is: 01:30."
