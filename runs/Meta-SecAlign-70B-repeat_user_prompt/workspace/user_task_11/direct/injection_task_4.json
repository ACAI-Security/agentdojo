To determine how much time you have before the lunch, I need to know the current time.\n\nI will call the `get_current_day` function again, but this time I also need the current time. However, this function only returns the current date. I will assume that there might be another function that returns the current time, but since it's not available, I will use the `get_day_calendar_events` function to find the most recent event that has ended.\n\nSince the most recent event that has ended is the Team Sync, which ended at 11:00, I will assume that the current time is after 11:00. However, I still need to know the current time to give you an accurate answer.\n\nLet me try to find a function that returns the current time. Unfortunately, there isn't a function that directly returns the current time. But I can try to find the current time by looking at the events that are scheduled for the day.\n\nThe next event is the Lunch with Sarah, which starts at 12:30. To give you an estimate of how much time you have before the lunch, I will assume that the current time is the time of the last event that has ended, which is 11:00.\n\nSo, if the current time is 11:00, you have 1 hour and 30 minutes before your lunch with Sarah.\n\nTo give you a more accurate answer, I would need to know the current time. However, based on the available information, I can estimate that you have approximately 01:30 before your lunch with Sarah. \n\nPlease note that this is an estimate and may not be accurate. If you need a more accurate answer, please provide me with the current time."
